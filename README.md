# FitLog ðŸ’ª
FitLog is a program that allows users to create an account and log their workout information by clicking on which day they worked out on. All data will be saved to their account.

Users without an account will be unable to track their exercises because they will not have access to the "Workout Log" and the "Workout Calendar" features. Only users that have created an account and have logged in will gain full access to the site. 

Have fun tracking your workout progress ðŸ˜Š!
